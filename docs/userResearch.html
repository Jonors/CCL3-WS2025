        <h2>Usability Test Plan</h2>
        <p>
            This plan outlines the evaluation of the MoviLog Android application. By moving beyond simple instruction-based testing to
            <strong>goal-oriented scenarios</strong>, we aim to observe how naturally users interact with our movie management system.

            <h3>1. Heuristic Evaluation (Pre-Test)</h3>
            <p>Prior to user testing, a team evaluation based on Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics identified the following areas of concern:</p>

            <h4>3.2 System Usability Scale (SUS) (Placeholder)</h4>
            <p>
                MoviLog achieved a very high System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 89.29 (SD=6.41).
                The tight interval of [83.36, 95.21] indicates a high degree of certainty in the results. Even at the lowest end of the confidence interval (83.36), the system remains in the "Excellent" category.

            <p><strong>Common negative comments:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>“I would like to have a function where i can add Movies to lists even if i haven't watched the Movie yet”</em></li>
                <li><em>“The NavBar looks a bit boring”</em></li>
                <li><em>“The Heatmap on the Stats screen looks a bit confusing”</em></li>

            <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
            <ul>
                In conclusion, the usability study for MoviLog revealed that the application has exceptional user friendliness, evidenced by an "Excellent" System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 89.29. Participants specifically highlighted the professional design aesthetic and the seamless integration of the movie search functionality as major strengths of the platform. However, to further refine the user experience, the ability to add unwatched movies to custom lists, the visual appeal of the navigation bar, and the clarity of the statistics heatmap should be improved.            </ul>

        <h3>Final reflection</h3>
        <h4>Jona Jožef Zeichen</h4>
        <p>
            With the final product now in front of me, I am very proud of us. The app works and feels smooth and professional.
            Yes, we could tweak one or two little things for sure to make it feel even better, but I am very happy with what we
            accomplished in these two weeks. Thinking back to the start, it was a very funny coincidence that Paul’s and my MC
            projects actually complemented each other very well in regards to what we wanted to build. He had the watchlist and I
            had a list with lists inside. We did start from scratch, but we knew how to tackle the structure and we got working results
            pretty fast. The biggest challenge was finding out how to talk to the database to not only get movies, but how to get
            movies that aren't NSFW and have a certain amount of ratings so that the search isn't cluttered with very obscure and
            2 minute long movies. It was nice to again experience the CCL feeling of really working on something for a fixed time
            and getting a much better understanding of the tools we are using, in this case, Android Studio, Git, and Kotlin.
            So, all I can add at the end is that I had a lot of fun and am proud of the product.
        </p>

        <h4>Paul Hitzl</h4>
        <p>
            I am really proud of what we achieved with this project, and I think the app turned out very well. At the beginning, I honestly didn’t know how it would be possible to build something cool in just two weeks, especially because I wasn’t very confident using Android Studio. However, in the end, everything came together and the result is actually pretty impressive.
            For me, the hardest part of the project was embedding the API into the app and fetching all the data we needed. It took some time to understand how everything connects, but once it worked, it felt really rewarding and helped me learn a lot.
            I also really enjoyed working together as a team. We made fast progress, constantly found new things to improve, and kept building better and better versions of the app. That process was one of my favorite parts, seeing the app improve step by step and knowing that it actually worked.
            I really like the design of the app as well. Everything looks professional, and it’s easy and enjoyable to use. It would be great to have the app working on an iPhone too, so I could actually use it myself in everyday life.
